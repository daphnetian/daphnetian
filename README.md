<h2> Hi, I’m Daphne! 🐅</h2>

I'm an aspiring ux designer + dev at University of British Columbia 
with the intent of pursuing cogitive systems (compsci stream) in the faculty of science.
My interests lie in the applications of tech and psychology—and their intersections—
towards the creation of innovative and meaningful products for people. 👩🏻‍💻🧠 

- 🌱 Currently learning ux design + javascript!
- 📫 In progress!
